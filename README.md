# MIDI Matches

[MIDI Matches](https://midimatches.onrender.com/) is a browser-based online multiplayer game that aims to combine the joy of improvisational keyboard with the thrill of friendly competition.

The core game mechanic revolves around facing off with other musicians on creating short keyboard solos over beats.

## Game Mechanic

Each game consists of multiple rounds of recording and voting. The structure of a round is as follows; at the beginning of a round,
a random sample beat is selected for all players to record over. Every player in the game then independently records their own keyboard
solo over the sample beat. Players listen to all other players' recordings and vote on their favorite. The player with the most votes
at the end of the game wins.
